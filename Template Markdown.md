## Background

### Goal of Analysis

*Describe the goal of this analysis. Include your research questions and if there is a potential hypothesis.*

### Glossary

-   **Term** --- *Definition of term, with context and any decisions made around that term.*

### Data

-   [Dataset Name](URL) --- *Describe the data in the source.* \| [Metadata](URL)

### Tools

-   [Tool](URL) --- *Describe what the tool was used for*

> [!NOTE] I recommend including the key add-ons that you will always use in your analysis, with a quick explanation of what that tool does. You can also create a section that lists common add-ons and what they do or API access keys you'll need to use them.

### Limitations

> [!Important] Include clear limitations or caveats to your analysis here. For example, the data may have gaps or the code may only be able to handle so much.

## Cleaning

> [!Important] Below you will document all code processes, in or out of RStudio that you used to clean the data. You can break out your cleaning process into subsections to make navigation easier.

1.  Describe what your code is doing in plain english, with a step number to help organize the process

```         
Put the code for that step in a chunk that can be separated out. 
If you have to scroll to see the contents of a whole chunk, it is probably too long and needs to be broken up into smaller steps.
```

## Analysis

> [!Important] Include step-by-step instructions and code for your analysis of the data and explain the results that appear. You can break out your analysis into subsections to make navigation easier.

## Future Work or Questions

> [!Important] Make a note of questions this analysis left unanswered, follow-up work that could come in the future, or notes for how to revisit/improve the analysis in the future.
