## Cleaning

> [!Important]
> Below you will document all code processes, in or out of RStudio that you used to clean the data. You can break out your cleaning process into subsections to make navigation easier.

1. Describe what your code is doing in plain english, with a step number to help organize the process

```
Put the code for that step in a chunk that can be separated out. If you have to scroll to see the contents of a whole chunk, it is probably too long and needs to be broken up into smaller steps.
```

## Analysis

> [!Important]
> Include step-by-step instructions and code for your analysis of the data and explain the results that appear. You can break out your analysis into subsections to make navigation easier.
