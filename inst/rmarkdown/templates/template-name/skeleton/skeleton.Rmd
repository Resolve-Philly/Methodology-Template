# Background

## Goal of Analysis

*Describe the goal of this analysis. Include your research questions and if there is a potential hypothesis.*

## Glossary

-   **Term** --- *Definition of term, with context and any decisions made around that term.*

## Data

-   [Dataset Name](URL) --- *Describe the data in the source.* \| [Metadata](URL)

## Tools

-   [R and RStudio](https://www.r-project.org/) --- For cleaning and analyzing the data. Below are the packages used specifically for this project. *This template pre-loads packages that are commonly used.* In the `setup` chunk are packages that are always run, no matter what.
-   [Tool](URL) --- *Describe what the tool was used for*

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidycensus) #For census data
  census_api_key("KEY")
library(tidygeocoder) #For geocoding
library(tigris) #Load Census TIGER/Line Shapefiles
library(sf) #Load Simple Features for R - Ref:
library(sp) #spacial data library, useful with: http://paldhous.github.io/NICAR/2023/r-sf-mapping-geo-analysis.html
library(broom) #mapping functions
```

## Limitations

*Include clear limitations or caveats to your analysis here. For example, the data may have gaps or the code may only be able to handle so much.*

# Cleaning

*Below you will document all code processes, in or out of RStudio that you used to clean the data.*

1. Describe what your code is doing in plain english, with a step number to help organize the process

```{r chunkName}
#Put the code for that step in a chunk that can be separated out. 
#If you have to scroll to see the contents of a whole chunk, it is probably too long and needs to be broken up into smaller steps.
```

# Analysis

*Include step-by-step instructions and code for your analysis of the data and explain the results that appear.*

# Future Work or Questions

*Make a note of questions this analysis left unanswered, follow-up work that could come in the future, or notes for how to revisit/improve the analysis in the future.*
